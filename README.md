# K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm
This is a K-Means Clustering Algorithm for Machine Learning! 

K-Means Clustering is also interpreted as finding the centroid (or mean
value of data) to determine similarity in its dataset. 

We then use this to recommend specific data to users, depending 
on the use case! 

Packages to install:

    pip install seaborn

Happy Coding!
